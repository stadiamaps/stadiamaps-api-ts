# Development Guide

## OpenAPI Code Generation

Much of the code in this project is generated by the OpenAPI generator.
Regenerating the generated portions of the codebase can be done simply with this command
(run this whenever new features / changes to the OpenAPI spec are released).

```shell
openapi-generator generate -i https://api.stadiamaps.com/openapi.yaml -g typescript-fetch --strict-spec true -o src
```

## Tests

The project includes some unit tests as a sanity check, utilizing mocks and real API responses,
as well as integration tests. The test suites are specified using Jest and are fairly straightforward.

```shell
npm run test
```

To run integration tests, you need to set the environment variable `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true`.
You'll also need an API key (with access to all services, or else some tests will fail!). You can store
one or both of these in `.env` in the repo root.

```
API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEY
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true
```

## Build

Finally, you can do a dist build as you might expect:

```shell
npm run build
```
