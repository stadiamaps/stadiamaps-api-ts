/**
 * Our database is organized into several layers (in the GIS sense of the term) as follows:
 * 
 * - `venue`: Points of interest, businesses, and things with walls
 * - `address`: Places with a street address
 * - `street`: Streets, roads, highways
 * - `county`: Places that issue passports, nations, nation-states
 * - `macroregion`: A related group of regions (mostly in Europe)
 * - `region`: The first administrative division within a country (usually states and provinces)
 * - `macrocounty`: A related group of counties (mostly in Europe)
 * - `county`: Official governmental areas; usually bigger than a locality, but almost always smaller than a region
 * - `locality`: Towns, hamlets, cities, etc.
 * - `localadmin`: Local administrative boundaries
 * - `borough`: Local administrative boundaries within cities (not widely used, but present in places such as NYC and Mexico City)
 * - `neighbourhood`: Social communities and neighborhoods (note the British spelling in the API!)
 * - `postalcode`: Postal codes used by mail services (note: not used for reverse geocoding)
 * - `coarse`: An alias for simultaneously using all administrative layers (everything except `venue` and `address`)
 * - `marinearea`: Places with fishes and boats.
 * - `ocean`: A really big marine area.
